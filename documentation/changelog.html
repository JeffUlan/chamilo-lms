<h1>Chamilo 1.8.7 - ? ?</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Chamilo 1.8.7 is a intermediate&nbsp;release including a lot of new features, mostly focused on social network, the handling of sessions (which will help many educational institutions, public or private, to manage their contents in a more flexible way) and visual style, and a few important bugfixes. It lays the first stable stone in the Chamilo software project.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Full UTF-8 support has been implemented (Feature #272). UTF-8 becomes recommended system encoding to be used. It is recommended too that html-documents created with external tools to be UTF-8 encoded.
  <br />For newly installed systems: UTF-8 is the default value of the administrator's setting "Character set". Database tables are created for storing UTF-8 encoded texts.
  <br />For upgraded systems: Upgrade procedure does not change to UTF-8 the administrator's setting "Character set". This may be done later, on administrator's decision. During upgrade database tables are converted to UTF-8. Conversion to UTF-8 of stored in the file system html-documents is not performed, this is not mandatory.
  <br />Note about integration with external systems: Keep in maind that since version 1.8.7 texts kept in database are UTF-8 encoded. If an external system accesses database records directly, some corrections mignt be necessary about encoding used by the external database.

<h1>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 - August 2009</h1>
<h3>Release notes - summary</h3>
<p>Dokeos 1.8.6.1 is a minor&nbsp;release including just a few new features, mostly focused on internationalization, and several bugfixes.</p>
<h3>New Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented new sub-language feature by which language terms redefinition becomes possible through the admin section (FS#4321)</li>
  <li>Admin: Terms and conditions added DT#4320</li>
  <li>Improvements in document tool, allow seeing glossary terms (FS#4337)</li>
  <li>Small improvements in SCORM export(FS#4300)</li>
  <li>At the beginning of the installation script, added an imperative check for PHP 5 has been added. (FS#4296)</li>
  <li>When the system Dokeos is switched into "Test server" mode, a clickable indicator appears in the footer. This indicator is visible by platform administrators only. (FS#4341)</li>
  <li>A transliteration function has been added. Currently, it is used in uploading files. Files with non-English names get names that contain ASCII letters only, remaining readable in the corresponding language. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not manage file name encodings, adding such a non-native feature involves too much work. For avoiding character encoding problems, transliteration of file names is the possible solution. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>An internationalization option has been added for improving sorting in arbitrary language. When the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php" target="_blank">intl</a> php-extension has been installed, various sorting routines exploit it for better sorting. Rationale: The PHP5 run-time environment does not provide native and reliable way of sorting UTF-8 strings. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>Installation script: The page about system requilements has been updated. Also, at the very beginning, a check has been added whether the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php" target="_blank">mbstring</a> php-extension is installed - see <a href="http://dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29548" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#306)</li>
  <li>A new php-based configuration for the online editor has been implemented, see <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/myconfig.php</i>. Also, toolbar definitions have been split in separate php-files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . Customization of the editor is more convenient and flexible now. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A upgrade from FCKEditor 2.6.4 to <strong>FCKEditor 2.6.4.1</strong> has been implemented. (FS#4383)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Blocking copy/paste for trainees has been added. The feature is configurable through editing the toolbar definition files within the directory <i>dokeos/main/inc/lib/fckeditor/toolbars/</i> . (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Preview tabs have been added to the dialogs for inserting video, flv-video, and YouTube video. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The <strong>audio</strong> plugin has been activated by default as an implementation of the "Insert audio / Audio properties" dialog. This new plugin is intended to replace the "MP3" plugin. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The simple file manager, the advanced file manager and the image manager have been integrated by default with the editor's dialog system. Thus, they work faster and in a more secure way. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: Configuration of the <strong>mimetex</strong> plugin has been reworked to gain simplicity. The procedure for configuration has been updated, see <a href="http://www.dokeos.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=29594" target="_blank">the related forum topic</a>. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: A new <strong>asciimath</strong> plugin for inserting mathematical formulas has been added. It is based on the <a href="http://mathcs.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html" target="_blank">ASCIIMathML.js</a> library. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Social: Added possibility to define RSS feeds inside personal page of social network (need to define an 'rssfeeds' extra user text field)</li>
</ul>

(FS#2867)</li>
  <li>Online editor: The toolbar icons have been upgraded to those from FCKEditor 3.0. (FS#2867)</li>
  <li>A solution has been implemented for fixing the <a href="http://bugs.adobe.com/jira/browse/FP-529" target="_blank">"__flash__removeCallback" bug</a>, which affects the media player on Internet Explorer browser. (FS#4378 and FS#2867)</li>
