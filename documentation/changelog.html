   		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Document templates have been greatly improved to speed-up custom course content creation</li>
	<li>Audiorecorder (depending on streaming server) now records sounds in the document/audio directory, making them easily reusable by the course admin</li>

    <li>Bugfix: registering a new user resulted in the language field of the user being empty which resulted in an english profile by default. This has now been changed to the platform language. </li>

</ul>
<br />

<ul>
    <li>Audiorecorder takes a few seconds to write the audio file back to the document directory, so the page shouldn't be changed too quickly after recording a sound track</li>
    <li>When migrating from 1.6 to 1.8, some SCORM learning paths might need to be re-imported, which means their tracking is lost</li>
</ul>
