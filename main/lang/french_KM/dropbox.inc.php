/**
 * Dropbox module for Dokeos/Claroline
 * language file in English language.
 * To make a version in your own language, you have 2 options:
 * 		- if you want to make use of the multilanguage tool in Claroline (this way you
 * 		can make 2 seperate courses in 2 different languages and Claroline will take
 * 		care of the translations) this file must be placed in the .../claroline/lang/English/
 * 		directory and the copy of this file that contains the translations must be placed in
 * 		the .../claroline/lang/YourLang/ directory. Be sure to give the translated version the same
 * 		name as this one.
 * 		- if you're sure you will only need the dropbox module in 1 language, you can just leave this
 * 		file in the current directory (.../claroline/plugin/dropbox/) and translate each variable into
 * 		the correct language.
 *
 * @version 1.20
