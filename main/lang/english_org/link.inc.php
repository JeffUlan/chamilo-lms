<?php
// Link Tool v2.0
// Developped by Patrick Cool, Ghent University, december 2003

// The main concept is that similar links can be grouped together into
// a category of links.
// I used the same interface as the bookmarks/favorites of your browser:
// categories can be collapsed / expanded.

// New features:
// 1. Adding Categories allowing similar links to be grouped together into categories
// 2. Ordering of links and categories: The categories itself and the links within a categories can be ordered
// 3. Description: Categories can have a description too
// 4. root category. Links added to the root category (thus having no category) are always visible
// 5. possibility to collapse / expand all the categories at once, thus showing or hiding all links
//
