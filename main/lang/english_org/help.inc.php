 Where email allows one-to-one dialogue, forums allow public or semi-public (group)

 browser to use Dokeos forums.</P><p>To organise forums, click on
 'Forum Administration'. Discussions are organised in sets and subsets as
 following:</p><p><b>Category > Forum > Topic > Answers</b></p>To structure
 your users discussions, it is necessary to organise categories and
 forums beforehand, leaving the creation of topics and answers to them. By
 default, the Dokeos forum only contains the category 'Public', a sample
 forum and a sample topic.</p><p>The first thing you should do is deleting
 the sample topic and modify the first forum name. Then, you can
 create, in the 'public' category, other forums, by by themes, to
 fit your learning scenario requirements.</p><p>Don't mix Categories and
 forums, and don't forget that an empty category (without forums) does not
 appear on the member view.</p><p>The description of a forum can be the
 list of its members, the definition of a goal, a task, a theme...</p>
 <p>Group forums should not be created through Forum tool but through Groups tool. There you will be allowed to decide whether your group forums are private or public.</p>
 <b>Pedagogically advanced use</b>
 <p>Some leaders / trainers use the forum to post corrections. One member/trainee publishes a paper. The leader corrects it using the edit button (yellow pencil) then the WYSYWIG editor to correct it (use colors and underline to show errors and corrections for instance) and the other members/trainees benefit of this correction.";

<b>Navigation</b>
<p>To browse your area, you have 2 navigation tools. One on top left is a tree showing where you are and how deep you are in the area. On top right, you can access to a tool through its icon in one clic. Whether you select your area code on left (always UPPER CASE) or the house icon on the right, you will reach the home page of your area. </p>
<b>Best practice</b>
<p>To motivate your members, it is important that your Area is a dynamic area. This will indicate that there is 'somebody behind the screen'. A quick way to give this feeling is to edit the Introduction text (clic on yellow pencil) at least evey week to tell latest news, forthcoming deadlines and so on.</p>
<p>To build your area, it might proove relevant to follow these steps:
<ol><li>In area Settings, check area Acces : Private and Subscription : Denied. This way, nobody can enter your Area during building process,</li>
<li>Show all the tools clicking on the grey link below the ones situated at the bottom of the page,</li>
<li>Use the tools you need to 'fill' your area with content, events, guidelines, tests etc.,</li>
<li>Hide all tools : your home page is empty in member view,</li>
<li>Use the Path tool to structure the way members will visit it and learn with it. This way, you use the other tools, but you don't show them at first sight.</li>
<li>Click on the eye icon besides the path you created : this path will then show on your home page,</li>
<li>The preparation of your Area is over. Your home page shows an introdution text followed by one link only and this link drives members through the area. Clic on member view (top right) to see things from a member point of view.<I></I></li></ol>";

$langHClar="Dokeos Help";

$langClarContent="<p><b>Teacher</b></p>
<p>Dokeos is a Learning and Knowledge Management System. It allows the leader to organise learning materials, learning paths  and to manage the interaction with his/her members. All this is made inside the web browser.</p>
<p>To use Dokeos as a leader, you need a login and a password. Depending on the security settings of your portal, you an get these by self-registration (right hand menu) or from the central administration of your organisation. Note that a login and a password never contain spaces or acents and that they are case sensitive. Type your login/password, then Create an area (top right) or use the area that has been created for you by the central administration of your organisation.</p>
<p>To add a colleague as co-administrator of your area:
<ol><li>If he/she is not yet registered in the system, register him/her and select 'Teacher' as a profile,</li>
<li>If he/she is already registered in the system, temporarily open area subscription in area settings and ask him/her to enroll in your area. Then edit his/her profile and give him/her leader rights.</li></ol></p>
<p>
Every Dokeos tool contains a contextual help represented by a red buoy. If you don't find there the good information, consider checking the Dokeos documentation page: <a href=\"http://www.dokeos.com/documentation.php\">http://www.dokeos.com/documentation.php</a> and download the leader manual. in your own language or in English</p>
<p><b>Student</b></p>
<p>This portal allows you to follow and participate to areas, trainings, collaborative workshops etc. It has been created to promote active learning: project-based, problem-based, casesbased learning, collaborative research etc.
Your leaders have build learning areas that can present as simple documents folders or sophisticated self-learning or group learning sequences of activities.</p>
<p>Registration process can vary from one organisation to the other. In some cases, self-registration is allowed. In others, you should get from the central administration a login and a password.</p>";





// help.php?open=Doc

$langHDoc="Help Documents";

$langDocContent="<p>The Documents tool is similar to the FileManager of
 your desktop computer.</p><p>You can create simple web pages ('Create a document') or upload files of any type (HTML, Word,
 Powerpoint, Excel, Acrobat, Flash, Quicktime, etc.). Your only concern
 must be that your users have the corresponding software to read them.
 Some file types can contain viruses, it is your responsibilty not to
 upload virus contaminated files, unless your portal admin has installed a server side anti=virus software. 
 It is, anyway, a worthwhile precaution to check documents with
 antivirus software before uploading them.</p>
<p>The documents are presented in alphabetical order.<br><br><b>Tip : </b>If
 you want to present them in a different order, numerate them: 01, 02,
 03... Or use the Learning Path to present a sophisticated Table of Contents. Note that once your documents are uploaded, you may decide to hide the documents area and show only one page on Home page (Add link on home page orange tool) or a Learning Path containing some documents from your Documents area.</p>
<p>You can :</p>
<H4>Create a document</H4>
<p>Select Create a document > Give it a title (no spaces, no accents) > type your text > Use the buttons of the Wysiwyg (What You See Is What You Get) editor to structure information, create tables, styles etc. To create web pages, you will need to get familiar with 3 concepts : Links, Images and Tables. Note that web pages offer less layout possibilities than Ms-Word pages. Note too that instead of creating a document in the editor, you can also cut and paste existing content from a web page or a Word document. This is an easy and quick way to migrate content onto your Dokeos area.
</p>
<ul><li><b>To add a link</b>, you need to copy the URL of the target somewhere. We suggest that you open 2 browser windows simultaneously, one with your dokeos area and the other to browse the web. Once you find the page you are looking for (note that this page can be inside your dokeos area), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C), go back to your page editor, select the word that will be the link, click on the small chain icon, paste the URL of your target there and validate. Once your page is saved, test the link to see if it opens the target. Note that you can decide in the Link popup menu if the link will create a new page or replace your dokeos page in the same window.</li>
<li><b>To add an image</b>, the principle is similar to the link feature : browse the web with a 2nd window, find the image (if the image is inside your area's documents area, select 'No frames' to get the image only and not the context), copy its URL (CTRL+C or APPLE+C in the URL bar after selecting the whole URL) then go back to your web page editor, position your mouse in the form where you want your image to appear, then click on the small tree icon and copy the URL of the target image into the URL field, Preview and validate. Note that in web pages, you can not redimension your images like in a PowerPoint presentation, neither can you re-locate the image anywhere in the page.</li>
<li><b>To add a table</b>, position your mouse in the field where you want the table to appear, then select the table icon in the Wysiwyg editor menu, decide for a number of columns and lines and validate. To get nice tables, we suggest that you choose the following values : border=1, cellspacing=0, cellpadding=4. Note that you will not be allowed to redimension your table or add lines or columns to it after its creation (sorry about this, it is just an online editor, not a word processor yet).</li>
</ul>

Scorm contents are special coachials which were designed according to an international norm : <b>Scorm</b>. This is a special format for learning contents which enables the free exchange of these materials between different Learning Management Systems. In other words, <b>Scorm</b> materails are platform independent, their import and export are simple.

// help.php?open=User

$langHUser="Help Users";
$langUserContent="<p><b>Adding users</b></p>
 <p>You can add members one by one in your area. Don't forget that if they are already registered in the system, this will give them 2 logins. So it might proove more practical to decide between self-registration by members or central adminisrative registration, then avoid systematically any registration by the leader. This is due to the fact that the leader only controls his area shere the member has a profile among different areas.</p>
 <p><b>Description</b></p>
 <p>Description has no computer related function.
 It does not give rights on the system. It just indicates to
 Humans, who is who. You can modify it by clicking on the pencil, then typing whatever you want: professor, assistant, member,
 visitor, expert...</P>
<p><b>Admin rights</b></p>
<p>Admin rights, on the other hand, correspond to the technical
 authorisation to modify the content and organisation of the area. You can only choose between giving all the admin
 rights and giving none of them.</P>
<p>To allow an assistant, for instance, to co-admin the area, you need to be sure he/she is already registered, then click
 on the pencil, then check 'Teacher', then 'Ok'.</P>
<p><b>Co-teachers</b></p>
<p>To mention in the header of the area the name of a
 co-teacher (co§chairmen, etc.), use the tool 'Course settings'. This
 modification does not register your co-teacher as a user of the area.
 The field 'Teachers' is completely independant of the Users
 list.</p>
 <p><b>Tracking and Personal Home Pages</b></p>
 <p>In addition to showing the users list and modifying their rights, the Users tool also shows individual tracking and allows the leader define headings for personal home pages to be filled-in by members.</p>";


// Help Group

$langGroupManagement="Help groups";
$langGroupContent="<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>This tool allows to create and manage workgroups.
At creation (Create groups), groups are empty. There are
many ways to fill them:
<ul><li>automatically ('Fill groups (random)'),</li>
<li>manually ('Edit'),</li>
<li>self-registration by users (Groups settings: 'Self registration allowed...').</li>
</ul>
These three ways can be combined. You can, for instance, ask users to self-register first.
Then discover that some of them didn't register and decide to fill groups automatically (random) in
order to complete them. You can also edit each group to compose membership user by user after or before self-registration and/or automatical filling.</p>
<p>Groups filling, whether automatical or manual, works only if there are already users
registered in the area. Users list is visible in <b>Users</b> tool. </p><hr noshade size=1>
<p><b>Create groups</b></p>
<p>To create new groups, click on 'Create new group(s)' and determine number of groups to
create.</p><hr noshade size=1>
<p><b>Group settings</b></p>
<p>You can determine Group settings globally (for all groups).
<b>Users are allowed to self-register in groups</b>:
<p>You create empty groups, users self-register.
If you have defined a maximum number, full groups do not accept new members.
This method is good for leaders who do not know the users list when
creating groups.</p>
<b>Tools</b>:</p>
<p>Every group possesses either a forum (private or public) or a Documents area
(a shared file manager) or (in most cases) both.</p>
<hr noshade size=1>
<p><b>Manual editing</b></p>
<p>Once groups are created (Create groups), you see at the bottom of the page, a list of groups
with a series of informations and functions 
<ul><li><b>Edit</b> to modify manually Group name, description, coach,
members list.</li>

$langHExercise="Help tests";

$langExerciseContent="<p>The tests tool allows you to create tests that will contains as many questions as you like.<br><br>
There are various types of answers available for the creation of your questions :<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple choice (Unique answer)</li>
  <li>Multiple choice (multiple answers)</li>
  <li>Matching</li>
  <li>Fill in the blanks</li>
</ul>
A test gathers a certain number of questions.</p>
<hr>
<b>Test creation</b>
<p>In order to create a test, click on the link &quot;New test&quot;.<br><br>
Type the test name, as well as an optional description of it.<br><br>
You can add an audio or a video file, for listening comprehension etc. It is up to you to choose these files as light as possible so that they download easily through the web. Prefer .mp3 files to .wav file for instance, because of a better compression and then smaller file size.
<br>
<br>
You can also choose between 2 test types :<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Questions on an unique page</li>
  <li>One question per page (sequential)</li>
</ul>
and tell if you want questions to be randomly sorted at the time of test running.<br><br>
Then, save your test. You will go to to the question administration.</p>
<hr>
<b>Adding a question</b>
<p>You can now add a question into the test previously created. The description is optional, as well as the picture that you have the possibility to link to your question.</p>
<hr>
<b>Multiple choice</b>
<p>In order to create a MAQ / MCQ :<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Define the answers for your question. You can add or delete an answer by clicking on the right button</li>
  <li>Check the left box for the correct answer(s)</li>
  <li>Add an optional comment. This comment won't be seen by the user untill he/she has answered to the question</li>
  <li>Give a weighting to each answer. The weighting can be any positive or negative integer, or zero</li>
  <li>Save your answers</li>
</ul></p>
<hr>
<b>Fill in the blanks</b>
<p>This allows you to create a text with gaps. The aim is to let the user find words that you have removed from the text.<br><br>
To remove a word from the text, and so to create a blank, put this word between brackets [like this].<br><br>
Once the text has been typed and blanks defined, you can add a comment that will be seen by the member when it replies to the question.<br><br>
Save your text, and you will enter the next step that will allow you to give a weighting to each blank. For example, if the question worths 10 points and you have 5 blanks, you can give a weighting of 2 points to each blank.</p>
<hr>
<b>Matching</b>
<p>This answer type can be chosen so as to create a question where the user will have to connect elements from an unit U1 with elements from an unit U2.<br><br>
It can also be used to ask the user to sort elements in a certain order.<br><br>
First define the options among which the user will be able to choose the good answer. Then, define the questions which will have to be linked to one of the options previously defined. Finally, connect via the drop-down menu elements from the first unit with those of the second one.<br><br>
Notice : Several elements from the first unit can point to the same element in the second unit.<br><br>
Give a weighting to each correct matching, and save your answer.</p>
<hr>
<b>Test modification</b>
<p>In order to modify a test, the principle is the same as for the creation. Just click on the picture <img src=\"../img/edit.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the test to modify, and follow instructions above.</p>
<hr>
<b>Test deleting</b>
<p>In order to delete a test, click on the picture <img src=\"../img/delete.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the test to delete it.</p>
<hr>
<b>Test enabling</b>
<p>So as for a test to be used, you have to enable it by clicking on the picture <img src=\"../img/invisible.gif\" border=\"0\" align=\"absmiddle\"> beside the test name.</p>
<hr>
<b>Running the test</b>
<p>You can test your exercise by clicking on its name in the tests list.</p>
<hr>
<b>Random questions</b>
<p>At the time of test creation / modification, you can tell if you want questions to be drawn in a random order among all questions of the test.<br><br>
By enabling this option, questions will be drawn in a different order every time users will run the test.<br><br>
If you have got a big number of questions, you can also choose to randomly draw only X questions among all questions available in that exercise.</p>
<hr>
<b>Questions pool</b>
<p>When you delete a test, its questions are not removed from the database, and they can be reused into a new test, via the questions pool.<br><br>
The questions pool also allows to reuse the same question into several tests.<br><br>
By default, all the questions of your area are hidden. You can show the questions related to a test, by chosing this one in the drop-down menu &quot;Filter&quot;.<br><br>
Orphan questions are questions that don not belong to any test.</p>";



$langHPath="Help Learning Path";

$langPathContent="
The Learning Path tool has two functions :
<ul><li>Create a learning Path</li>
<li>Upload a Scorm or IMS format Learning path</li></ul>
<img src=\"../img/path_help.gif\">
<p><b>
What is a Learning Path ?</b>
</p><p>A Learning Path is a sequence of learning steps included in modules. It can be content-based (looking like a table of contents) or activities-based, looking like an agenda or a programme of what you need to do in order to understand and practice a certain knowledge or know-how.</p><p>In addition to being structured, a learning path can also be sequenced. This means that some steps will constitute pre-requisites for others ('you cannot go to step 2 before step1'). Your sequence can be suggestive (you show steps one after the other) or imperative (you add pre-requisites so that people are forced to follow the sequence).
</p>
<p><b>How to create our own Learning Path ?</b></p>
<p>
The first step is to arrive to Learning Path Builder section. In
the Learning Path screen, there is a link to it. There you can create
many paths by clicking onto <i>Add a new learning path</i>. But they are
empty, till you add modules and steps to them.<br>If you make a path
visible, it will appear as a new tool on the homepage of the area. This
way their access is easier.</p>
<p>
<b>What are the steps for these paths ? (What are the items that can be added?)</b></p>
<p>All Dokeos tools, activities and contents that you consider to be useful and connected to your
imagined path can be added :<br><ul>
<li>Agenda items</li>
<li>Separate documents (texts, pictures, Office docs, ...)</li>
<li>Announcement items</li>
<li>Forums as a whole</li>
<li>Topics</li>
<li>Individual topic messages</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Dokeos Tests (you have to make these tests visible in the Tests tool, which you want
to present for members in paths)</li>
<li>Assignments page</li>
<li>Dropbox page</li>
<li>External links, which point out of Dokeos system</li></ul>
</p>
<p><b>
Other features of Learning Path</b>
</p>
<p>
Students can be asked to follow (read) your path in a given order, as you
can set <u>prerequisities</u> in the path. This means that for example members
cannot go to Quiz 2 till they have read Document 1. All items have a status :
completed or incomplete, so the progress of members is clearly available.
</p><p>
If you alter the original title of a step, the new title will appear in
the path, but the original title will not be deleted. So if you want
test8.doc to appear as 'Final Exam' in the path, you do not have to rename
the file, you can use the new title in the path. It is also useful
to give new titles to links as they are too long.
</p><p>
When finished, do not forget to check the member view, where the table of
contents appears on the left and the path steps usually appear on the right,
one by one.
</p><br><p><b>
What is a Scorm or IMS format Learning path and how to upload (import) it?</b>
</p>
<p>The learning path tool allows you to upload SCORM and IMS compliant area
contents.</p>
<p>SCORM  (<i>Sharable Content Object Reference Model</i>) is a public standard followed by major e-Learning actors
like NETg, Macromedia, Microsoft, Skillsoft, etc. and acting at three levels:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Economy</b> : Scorm allows whole areas or small content
units to be reusable on different Learning Management Systems (LMS)
through the separation of content and context,</li>
<li><b>Pedagogy</b> : Scorm integrates the notion of
pre-requisite or <i>sequencing</i> (<i>e.g. </i>\"You
cannot go to chapter 2 before passing Quiz 1\"),</li>
<li><b>Technology</b> : Scorm generates a table of contents as
an
abstraction layer situated outside content and outside the LMS. It
helps content and LMS communicate with each
other. What is communicated is mainly <i>bookmarks
</i>(\"Where is John in the
course?\"), <i>scoring</i> (\"How did John pass the test?\") and <i>time</i> (\"How much
time did John spent in chapter 1?\").</li>
</ul>
<b>How to create a SCORM compliant learning path?</b><br>
<br>
The most natural way is to use the Dokeos Learning Path Builder. However, you may want to create complete Scorm compliant websites locally on your own computer before uploading it onto your dokeos platform. In this case, we recommend the use of a sophisticated tool like Lectora&reg; or Reload&reg;
<br></p><p>
<b>Useful links</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Adlnet : authority responsible for Scorm normalisation, <a
href=\"http://www.adlnet.org/\">http://www.adlnet.org</a></li>
<li>Reload : Open Source free Scorm player and editor, <a
href=\"http://www.reload.ac.uk/\">http://www.reload.ac.uk</a></li>
<li>Lectora : Scorm publisher authoring software, <a
href=\"http://www.trivantis.com/\">http://www.trivantis.com</a><br>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>
Note :</b></p><p>
The Learning Path section lists all the <i>self-built Learning Paths</i>
and all uploaded <i>Scorm format Learning Paths</i>, as well. It is wise
to put every uploaded Scorm path into separate directories.
</p>";

$langHDescription="Help area Description";

$langDescriptionContent="<p>This tool will help you describe your area in a synthetic way and from the outside. It may help your future members get a clear view on what they can expect from this area. It is also an opportunity for you to rethink your area scenario.</p>Items are given here as proposals. If you want to Create an area description with your own items, use only the 'Other' item and decide for its title.</p>
<p>
To fill the area description, select Create and edit with forms &gt; Scrolldown menu and select the item of your choice &gt; fill the form &gt; Validate. You can always edit or delete the content of every item by clicking on the pencil or red cross icons.</p>"; 

$langHLinks="Help Links tool";

$langLinksContent="<p>The Links tool allows you to create a library of resources for your members. Especially resoucrs that you have not created yourself.</p>
<p>When the list grows, it might proove relevant to organise it into categories to help your members find the right information at the right place. You can edit every link to re-assign it into a new category (you need to create this category first).</p>
<p>The Description field can be used to give pre-information on the target web pages but also to describe what you expect the member to do with the link. If, for instance, you point to a website on Aristotle, the description field may ask the member to study the difference between synthesis and analysis. "; 





$langHMycourses="Help area Home Page";

$langMycoursesContent="<p>Once logged in the system, you are here in <i>your</i> page. You see:
<ul><li><b>My areas list</b> in the center of the page, and also (depending on your portal security settings) the possibility to create new ones (right hand menu),</li>
<li>In the top banner, <b>My Profile</b>: use this to modify your password, your username, upload your picture in the system or check your own tracking,</li>
<li><b>My agenda</b>: it contains all events of the areas you are registered in,</li>

<li>In the right hand menu: <b>Edit my areas list</b> that allows you to enroll in new areas as far as the tacher or the organisation has left these areas open to enrollment. Use this to un-register from areas too,
</li>
<li>The links  <b>Support Forum</b> and <b>Documentation</b> that point to the main Dokeos website, where you can ask technical or pedagogical questions, find more information.</li></ul>
To enter a area (central area of the page), clic on its name. Your profile can vary from one area to the other. It is possible that you are leader in one area and member in another. 
</p>";

$langHAgenda="Help Agenda";

$langAgendaContent="<p>The agenda appears both in each Area and as a synthetic tool for the member ('My agenda' in top banner).</p>
<p>In the area, the agenda appears as a list of events. You can attach documents or activities to a date so that the agenda becomes a chronological programme for your learning activities.</p>
<p>In addition to being present in the agenda, the new events are indicated to the member when he/she logs in the next time. The system tells what has been added in the Agenda (and in the Announcements) since his/her last visit : icons appear on the portal home page besides the areas where events and announcements hve been added.</p>
<p>If you want to go further in the logic of structuring learning activities one after the other, we suggest that you use preferably the Learning Path that offers the same principles with more advanced features. The Learning Path can be considered as a synthesis of a Table of Contens tool + an Agenda + sequencing (imposed order) and tracking.</p>"; 


$langHAnnouncements="Help Announcements";

$langAnnouncementsContent="<p>The Announcements tool allows you to send an email to all your members or to some of them or to some groups. It can proove efficient to drive members back to your website if they do not visit it very often.</p>
<p>To send a message to some users and/or some groups, select 'Messages to selected users' then use CTRL+C to select more than one in the left hand menu, click on the right arrow to move them then type your message in the field below.</p>";


$langHChat="Help Chat";

$langChatContent="<p>The Chat tool allows you to discuss live with your members.</p>
<p>This chat is not similar to usual ones, like MSN&reg; or Yahoo Messenger&reg; because it is web based. The disadvantage is that it refreshes only after 10 seconds and not immediately. The advantage is that it is integrated in your area,it archives your discussions into the Documents tool and it doesn't require from your members any plugin to download.</p>
<p>If users send their pictures in 'My Profile' (top banner), then this picture will appear in the discussion to help identify who is speaking.</p>
<p>Only the leader is allowed to delete the discussion when he/she finds it relevant.</p>
<p><b>Pedagogical relevance</b></p>
<p>Adding a chat to your area is not necessarily a good idea. However, if this participates to your scenario, the chat can help. You can imagine, for instance, to hide the chat always except at a certain time when you have a dedicated meeting with your members to answer their questions live. It is less a 'free' dicsussion tool this way, but you give members a guarantee that they will benefit from this live meeting.</p>.";






$langHWork="Help Assignments";

$langWorkContent="<p>The assignments tool is a very simple one. It allows your members to upload any document towards toe Area.</p>
<p>Depending on your area scenario, you have to decide if you want that all members see all documents (if, for instance you want to ask them give their opinion on each other's papers) or if you want that you are the only one to see the documents (if, for instance, you ask the same question to everybody and want to avoid cheating).</p>
<p>This tool has an Introduction text area to allow you write a question or detail guidelines or remind of a deadline or whatever you may find relevant.</p>";



$langHTracking="Help Tracking";

$langTrackingContent="<p>The tracking helps you follow your members : did they connect to the sytem, when, how many times? How much do they get in tests? Did they already upload their Paper? When? If you use Scorm areas, you can evn know how much time a member spent on a module or chapter. The trackinggives information at 2 levels:
<ul><li><b>Globally</b>: How many members access the area? What are the most visited pages and links?</i>
<li><b>Nominatively</i>: What pages has John Doe visited? What score does he get in tests? When was hs last connection on the system?</li>>/ul>";


$langHSettings="Help area settings";

$langSettingsContent="<p>Course settings allows you to manage the global parameters of your area : Title, code, language, name of leaders etc.</p>
<p>The options situated in the middle of the page deal with confidentiality settings : is the area public or private? Can members register to it? You can use these settigs dynamically : open registration during one week > ask your members to register > close access to registration > remove possible intruders through the Users list. This way you keep control of who is in byt you don't have the administrative hassle of registrating them yourself.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the page, you can Backup the area and delete it. Backup will create a file on the server and allow you to copy it on your own Hard Disk locally. So that there will be 2 backups of it in different places. If you backup a area then delete it. You will not be allowed to restore it yourself but the system administrator can do this for you if you give him/her the code of your area. Backuping a area is also a good way to get all your documents back onto your own computer. You will need a tool, like Winzip&reg; to UNZIP the archive. Note that backuping a area does not remove it in any way.</p>";



$langHExternal="Help Add a Link";

$langExternalContent="<p>Dokeos is a modular tool. You can hide and show tools whenever you want, according to your project or to its different chronological phases. But you can also add on your home page tools or pages that you have created yourself or that come from the outside of your Dokeos portal. This way, you will make of your area home page YOUR page.</p>
<p>To take possession of your page that way, you will Add links on it. These links can be of 2 types:
<ul><li><b>External link</b>: you create on your home page a link to a website situated outside your Area. In this case, you will select Target= In a new window because you don't want that website to replace your Dokeos environment.</li>
<li><b>Internal link</b>: you link towards a page or a tool inside your Dokeos area. To do this, you go first to that page or document or tool, you copy its URL from the URL bar of your browser (CTRL+C), then you go to Add a link and you paste this URL in the URL field and you give it the name you want. In this case, you will select Target=Same window because you will keep the Dokeos banner on top and the remain in the same environment.</li></ul>
Once created, these links cannot be edited. To modify them, the only solution is to deactivate them then delete them, then restart from zero.</p>";
