Infinite Family Network Connectivity Web Test

Installation
=============

1. Put all files of the directory with this README on a web server
2. Edit config.js with the desired settings
3. Make sure the web server accepts HTTP POST on index.html. 
If the web server does not allow HTTP POST, the test will yield an error message immediately when running a test.
A sample .htaccess file can be found in the same directory as the HTML file which can be used to allow HTTP POST 
on an Apache server with PHP installed.

Happy testing!
