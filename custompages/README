CustomPages looks for alternatives in this directory, and displays them if present. The user-provided custom pages must exactly be named as such :

- index-logged.php for the general landing page before login
- index-unlogged.php for the general landing page when already logged-in
- registration.php for the registration form
- registration-feedback.php for the registration success feedback
- lostpassword.php for the password recovery form
- lostpassword-feedback.php for the password recovery feedback page
