Chamilo LMS is a free software, community-driven project.

If you'd like to contribute, please read the following document:

* [Coding conventions][1]: The main conventions document
* [PSR-1][2]: PSR-1 are standard conventions rules we use as a base (conversion of old code still in progress)
* [PSR-2][3]: PSR-2 are more detailed standard conventions rules we use as base (conversion of old code still in progress)

We expect contributions to be sent through Pull Requests, a special feature of Github. We recommend you follow this guide to understand a little more about the way it works: https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/
