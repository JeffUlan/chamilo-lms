IMS/LTI plugin
===

Version 1.0 (beta)

Installation
------------
1. Install the plugin from Plugin page
2. Enable the plugin from Plugin Settings page
3. Assign to the Administrator region

As platform admin you can register external tools available for all courses.
You need set the tools settings in the IMS/LTI administration page.
Then the registered tools should be add in each course individually.

As teacher you can register external tools available only for the current course.
You need follow the link in the IMS/LTI block located in the Course Settings tool.
Then select a previously tool registered or register a new external tool.

This plugin is meant to be later integrated into Chamilo (in a major version release).

IMS/LTI defines the possibility to integrate tools or content into Chamilo.
This plugin allows the integration of a new tool into courses, without (for now) obtaining any data back from those tools.
It will gradually be developed to support IMS/LTI content items.
