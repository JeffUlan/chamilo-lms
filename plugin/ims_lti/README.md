IMS/LTI plugin
===

This plugin is meant to be later integrated into Chamilo (in a major version release).

IMS/LTI defines the possibility to integrate tools or content into Chamilo.
This plugin allows the integration of a new tool into courses, without (for now) obtaining any data back from those tools.
It will gradually be developed to support IMS/LTI content items.
