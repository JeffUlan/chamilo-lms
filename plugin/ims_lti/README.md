IMS/LTI plugin
===

Version 1.0 (beta)

Installation
------------
1. Install the plugin from Plugin page
2. Enable the plugin from Plugin Settings page
3. Assign to the Administrator region.

This plugin is meant to be later integrated into Chamilo (in a major version release).

IMS/LTI defines the possibility to integrate tools or content into Chamilo.
This plugin allows the integration of a new tool into courses, without (for now) obtaining any data back from those tools.
It will gradually be developed to support IMS/LTI content items.
