Courses purchase plugin for Chamilo LMS
=======================================
Users can access the purchases catalog to buy courses (or sessions, since v2 of
this plugin) enabled for purchase.
If the user is not registered or logged in, he/she will be requested to 
register/login before he/she can resume buying items.
Once the course is chosen, Chamilo shows available payment types (currently only
PayPal works) and lets the user proceed with the purchase.
Finally, the user receives an e-mail confirming the purchase and his account is
automatically modified to give him/her access to the course/session.
