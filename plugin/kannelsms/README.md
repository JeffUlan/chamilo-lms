Kannel SMS plugin
===

This plugin enables Chamilo to send SMS messages to Chamilo users when a notification email is sent.

SMS message types (a new course is created, an account is approved and so on) can be enabled or disabled from its plugin configuration option.

Kannel SMS requires a Kannel server (software) to be installed on the machine and a cellphone to be connected to this server (usually through a USB cable). The communication is thus made through the cellphone itself.

This is only for one-way communication from the Chamilo server to students cellphones.
