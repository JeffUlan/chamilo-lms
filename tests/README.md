# Chamilo 1.11.x tests directory

This directory is used for all kinds of tests and scripts and is removed from
public releases as it may represent a risk for production systems.

## Behat integration testing

The current automated tests are developed using Behat. To run them, you will
need a basic default installation of the corresponding version of Chamilo LMS,
which should include the vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat executable.

Make sure you set the right base_url in behat.yml, then run (on the command
line, from the tests/ directory): 
```
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/login.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/createUser.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/createCourse.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/courseTools.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/forum.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/socialGroup.feature
../vendor/behat/behat/bin/behat behat/features/accessCompanyReports.feature
```

This should run all tests and all of them should pass.
