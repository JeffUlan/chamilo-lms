If you want to give me some feedback or make a suggestion, create an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/filp/whoops/issues/new).

If you want to get your hands dirty, great! Here's a couple of steps/guidelines:

- Fork/clone this repo, and update dev dependencies using Composer

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:filp/whoops.git
$ cd whoops
$ composer install --dev
```

- Create a new branch for your feature or fix

```bash
$ git checkout -b feature/flames-on-the-side
```

- Add your changes & tests for those changes (in `tests/`).
- Remember to stick to the existing code style as best as possible. When in doubt, follow `PSR-2`.
- Send me a pull request!
