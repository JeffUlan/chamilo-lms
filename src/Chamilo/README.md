This directory contains the bundles for all Chamilo features already converted
to Symfony-style.

Particularly worthy of mentioning are CoreBundle and CourseBundle, which
contain, between other things, the definition for the settings a Chamilo admin
can configure from the interface: i.e. CoreBundle/Settings/ contains the classes
required for the definition of the configuration settings appearing in the
administration panel of Chamilo; the CourseBundle/Settings/ folder contains the
classes required for the definition of the course-level settings.
